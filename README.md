Fraud Call Detection using Naive Bayes Algorithm


Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a fraud call detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The primary goal is to analyze the accuracy of the model in identifying fraudulent phone calls based on call attributes.

Algorithm Used

We utilized the Naive Bayes algorithm for this project. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that calculates the probability of a given event occurring based on prior knowledge. It has shown effectiveness in various classification tasks, including fraud detection.

Dataset

We used a carefully curated dataset of phone call records for training and testing purposes. The dataset includes various attributes such as caller ID, call type, etc. This diverse dataset helps the model learn patterns associated with both legitimate and fraudulent calls.

Accuracy and Predictions

The accuracy of the fraud call detection model was evaluated using standard metrics, including:

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted fraudulent and non-fraudulent calls.
- Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted fraudulent calls to the total predicted fraudulent calls.
- Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted fraudulent calls to the total actual fraudulent calls.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Our model achieved an accuracy of [0.9827], with the following performance metrics:
- Precision: [0.98455]
- Recall: [0.98275]
- F1-score: [0.9845]


Results and Analysis

The results highlight the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm in detecting fraudulent phone calls. Our model showcases a strong performance in accurately classifying both legitimate and fraudulent calls. By achieving high precision and recall scores, we ensure that the system minimizes false positives and false negatives, respectively.

Conclusion

This project showcases the successful implementation of a fraud call detection system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The provided accuracy and predictions underline the model's reliability in identifying potentially fraudulent calls, thereby contributing to improved user security and protection against scams.
